		  	Basket.js was created as a response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/souders/statuses/166928191649357824">tweet</a> by Steve Souders asking that the jQuery project consider caching jQuery in localStorage for performance reasons. Intrigued by the idea, I began exploring a minimalist solution to it (just for the sake of experiment - nothing here should be considered for production). <em>(Note: I am by <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2011/03/28/storager-case-study-bing-google/">no</a> <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/localStorage_script_injection-wBm">means</a> the first person to explore this area. Also, storing files in localStorage is not considered an optimal approach by many. See <a href="http://paul.kinlan.me/we-need-to-kill-off-the-localstorage-api">this post</a> on killing off the API by Paul Kinlan).</em>
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  	You may remember Souders previously did research and a <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2011/03/28/storager-case-study-bing-google/">write-up</a> on search engines making use of localStorage caching back in 2011. His conclusions were:
		  	<blockquote>Bing and Google Search make extensive use of localStorage for stashing SCRIPT blocks that are used on subsequent page views. None of the other top sites from my previous post use localStorage in this way. Are Bing and Google Search onto something? Yes, definitely.</blockquote>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	 To help provide a more general solution for this problem, I put together a script loader that treats localStorage as a cache: if script(s) have previously been saved locally, they will simply be loaded and injected into the current document. If not, they will be XHR'd in for use right away, but cached so that no additional loads are required in the future.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	basket.js is extremely simple, but it gets the job done. Let's briefly review its API:
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li><strong>basket.require()</strong></li>
            <li><strong>basket.add()</strong></li>
            <li><strong>basket.remove()</strong></li>
		  	<li><strong>basket.wait()</strong></li>
		  </ul>

		  <p><strong>basket.require( uri )</strong></p>

        <p><em>uri:</em> A relative URI to a local script to load.</p>

        <p><code>.require()</code> allows us to construct loader chains, each of which instruct basket.js to fetch (either externally or from a localStorage cached-copy) a script defined by a supplied uri. The basic loading of a single uri could be achieved as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>basket.require('jquery.js');</code></pre>

        <p>This will check to see if an item with the key <code>basket-jquery.js</code> exists in localStorage (i.e a cached copy of the script). If present, the script contents are read from storage and injected into the current page. If not present, the script will be fetched, cached in storage and then similarly injected into the document for use.</p>

        <p>basket.js also supports chaining and so requesting multiple scripts is also straight-forward:</p>

        
        <pre><code>basket
    .require('jquery.js')
    .require('underscore.js')
    .require('backbone.js');</code></pre>

        <p><em>Note that at present, JSONP/server-side middleware is necessary for the support of remote scripts. This is down to access of script content being limited under cross-origin policies.</em></p>

        <p><strong>basket.add( uri, [,overwrite], [,callback] )</strong></p>

        <p><em>uri:</em> A relative URI to a local script to be saved to localStorage (but not executed)</p>

        <p><em>overwrite:</em> A boolean defining whether an entry being added can overwrite an existing entry with the same path/filename.</p>

        <p><em>callback:</em> An optional function to be executed once a script has been added to localStorage</p>

        <p><code>add()</code> allows you to add scripts to localStorage without actually injecting them into the current document. It accepts a URI, which it then fetches the contents of and caches. If the <code>overwrite</code> argument is supplied (and is true), basket.js will overwrite an existing entry for the script being added if one is found.</p>

        <pre><code>basket
    .add('jquery.js')
    .add('handlebars.js')
    .add('jquery.plugin1.js')
    .add('jquery.plugin2.js');</code></pre>

        <p>An example of how to use the <code>callback</code> is as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>basket
    .add('jquery.js')
    .add('handlebars.js', true, function(){
        console.log('jQuery and Handlebars exist in localStorage now');
    });</code></pre>

        <p><strong>basket.remove(uri)</strong></p>

        <p><em>uri:</em> A relative URI to a local script to be removed from localStorage</p>

        <p><code>remove()</code> will simply remove a previously cached script from localStorage. An example of how to use it can be seen below:</p>

        <pre><code>basket
    .remove('jquery.js')
    .remove('modernizr.js');</code></pre>

        <p><strong>basket.wait( [,callback] )</strong></p>

        <p><em>callback:</em> An optional function to be executed once a script has loaded</p>

        <p>When <code>wait()</code> is inserted into a chain, it informs the chain to ensure previous scripts inserted into the chain complete their loading prior to allowing the next item to load and execute. At it&rsquo;s most basic, <code>wait()</code> can be used as follows:</p>

        <pre><code>basket
    .require('jquery.js').wait()
    .require('jquery.plugin1.js')
    .require('jquery.plugin2.js');</code></pre>

        <p>You can also specify an (optional) callback (typically an anonymous function) that will be executed in order following the previous scripts executing and before subsequent scripts in the chain are executed.</p>

        <pre><code>basket
    .require('jquery.js')
    .require('underscore.js')
    .require('app.js').wait(function(){
        
        var numbers = [10, 5, 100, 2, 1000];
        $('#message')
            .html('Live long and prosper, bro. 
            Want the minimum value in our array? Boom:' + _.min(numbers));

    });</code></pre>

    <p>Finally, in case you're interested, here's the basket.js example that was used to power the intro to this page:</p>
    <pre><code>var message, str;

basket
    .require("test/jquery-1.7.1.min.js").wait()
    .require("test/underscore-min.js")
    .require("test/backbone-min.js").wait(function() {

        // Backbone is now available, so let's define
        // a test model with a sample attribute

        var testModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
          idAttribute: "_id"
        });

        // Create an instance of the model
        var myModel = new testModel({ _id: 4, name: "Nyan Cat" });

        // Cache a reference to our message holder with jQuery
        message = $('#message');

        // Where #intro contains a template, get our templating on:

        var templateContent = $('#intro').html(); 
        var compiled = _.template(templateContent);
        message.html( compiled({name: myModel.get('name')}));

    });
    </code></pre>

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
            The next phase for this project will be putting together <a href="http://jsperf.com">jsPerf</a> tests that compare localStorage caching vs. standard browser caching. There have been a number of attempts I've seen to previously achieve this on the site, but they have been somewhat <a href="http://jsperf.com/another-eval">unreliable</a>.</p>
            <p>The end-goal of this project is to help inform about the true benefits (or drawbacks) about localStorage caching for scripts so that developers can make informed decisions about employing the approach.

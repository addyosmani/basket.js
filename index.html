<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>We are currently investigating a number of different features we would like to bring to the project, as well as looking to produce some high-quality <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js/issues/24">performance benchmarks</a> (compared to IndexedDB, Browser cache and more). To find out more, check out <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js/issues">what we're working on</a>.</p>
